### Hi there, random stranger! :wave:

*Stay awhile and listen*

- I make handy CLI tools. :wrench:
- I quite like Rust. :crab:
- I do graphics and high-performance stuff. :racing_car:
- I like automation and when things just maintain themselves. Sadly though, they rarely do in practice. :robot:
- I am a developer and devops in [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) where I also maintain [a ton](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=&maintainer=svenstaro) of packages! :penguin:
