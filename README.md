### Hi there, random stranger! :wave:

*Stay awhile and listen*

- I make handy CLI tools. :wrench:
- I [quite like](https://github.com/svenstaro?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=rust) Rust. :crab:
- I do graphics and high-performance stuff. :racing_car:
- I like automation and when things just maintain themselves. Sadly though, they rarely do in practice. :robot:
- I am a [developer](https://www.archlinux.org/people/developers/#svenstaro) and [devops](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/svenstaro) in [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) where I also maintain [a ton](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=&maintainer=svenstaro) of packages! :penguin:

Also check out [svenstaro.org](https://svenstaro.org).

If you like my work, please consider [supporting me](https://github.com/sponsors/svenstaro)!
